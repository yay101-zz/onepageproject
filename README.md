# onepageproject
A template for a webpage using a single html file containing images and minimal javascript required. I'm starting this because i am sick of seeing small business spend thousands on websites that are:
- Bloated CMS for static pages.
- Hacked the second they forget to update.
- Hosted on overpriced platforms with too many attack vectors.
- Too large or complicated to backup or move to a new provider easily.
- Simply use too much ram for a website essentially made from links.
